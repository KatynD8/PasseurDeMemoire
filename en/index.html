      <h3>The concept of filmed biography</h3>
      <p>
        Tell the story of your life, your parents, your brothers and sisters‚Ä¶
        Your country of origin, your childhood memories, your family and
        professional life, the story of your aliyah‚Ä¶ Because you are not only a
        woman or a man, a grandmother or a grandfather‚Ä¶

        <h3>Why make a filmed biography?</h3>
        <p>
          Passing on your memories through images, sharing the sound of your
          voice with your loved ones and future generations is possible with a
          30 to 60-minute biographical film including photos or videos. Based on
          an interview, you can authentically transmit your memories, values,
          and personal story. It is important to preserve your memory and
          strengthen intergenerational bonds. Have you already told the story of
          your love encounter? Your career path, your passions, your
          commitments? Many people say they regret not having filmed memories of
          their parents or grandparents. It is possible thanks to a professional
          who helps you transmit your emotions and memories through a film.

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        I meet you for the first time to introduce myself, get to know you, and
        prepare the interview. Together, we talk about your life, your
        achievements, your parents, and your loved ones. We prepare the themes
        and questions you want to address. We decide on the story you wish to
        tell and the important moments you want to share. During filming, I
        capture the story of your life through a face-to-camera interview. It is
        an intimate and special moment with you that you will share with your
        loved ones. The process is always caring and fully respects the wishes
        you expressed during the preliminary interview. Afterward, I edit your
        video biography according to the vision we established, for an authentic
        and sincere story. You can also choose music or photos you would like to
        include in the video. Your video biography is delivered a few weeks
        later as a downloadable link as well as on a USB stick so you can watch
        your film on a computer or television.

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          A passionate person. I had a first professional life in France in the
          world of retail and training. When I arrived in Israel, I went back to
          university in Jerusalem to become a tour guide. I am passionate about
          sharing the history of Israel and the Jewish people, and for several
          years, I have been a TV columnist for Tandem TV. I have always been
          driven by the desire to pass on and share. Memory Keeper is the
          logical continuation of this will to transmit, with a human approach,
          active listening, and always an excellent sense of contact. I am
          animated by genuine curiosity, full of kindness. Filming, pacing,
          storytelling: I love transforming a story into a shared emotion.
