      <h3>The concept of a filmed biography</h3>
      <p>
        Tell your story, that of your parents, your brothers and sisters‚Ä¶
        Your country of origin, your childhood memories, your family and
        professional life, the story of your Aliyah‚Ä¶ Because you are not only a
        mother or father, a grandmother or grandfather‚Ä¶ A filmed biography is a
        gift of memory that connects generations.

        <h3>Why make a filmed biography?</h3>
        <p>
          To pass on your memories through images, to share the sound of your
          voice, for your loved ones and future generations. This is possible
          and easy with a 30 to 60-minute biographical film including photos
          or videos. From an interview, you can authentically share your
          memories, values, and story. It is important to preserve your
          memory and strengthen intergenerational bonds. Have you ever told
          your love story? Your professional journey, your passions, your
          commitments? Many people regret not having filmed memories of their
          parents or grandparents. And above all their voice‚Ä¶ This is possible
          thanks to a professional who offers to pass on your memories and
          emotions through a filmed biography.

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h5>Meeting and preparation</h5>
      I first meet with you to introduce myself, get to know you, and prepare
      the interview. Together, we discuss your life, your parents, and your
      loved ones. We prepare the topics and questions you wish to address. We
      decide on the story you want to tell and the important moments you want
      to share. We review the photos or documents you wish to include in your
      testimony.
      <h5>Filming in a chosen setting</h5>
      The filming can take place at your home or outdoors in a place dear to
      you. During filming, I capture the story of your life through an on-camera
      interview. It is an intimate and special moment with you that you will
      share with your loved ones. The process is always caring and fully
      respects the wishes you expressed during the initial meeting.
      <h5>Editing and delivery of the film</h5>
      After the interview, I edit your video biography according to the vision
      we established, for an authentic and sincere story. You may also choose
      music or photos to insert in the video. Your video biography will be
      delivered a few weeks later as a downloadable link or on a USB stick so
      you can watch it on a computer or television.

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          A memory keeper and a passionate storyteller. I had a first career in
          France in the retail and training industry. After moving to Israel,
          I studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to become a tour guide.
          I am passionate about transmitting the history of Israel and the Jewish
          world, and for several years I have been a TV columnist on related
          topics. I have always been driven by the desire to transmit and share.
          Being a memory keeper is the logical continuation of this will to
          transmit with a human approach, attentive listening, and an excellent
          sense of contact. I am guided by authentic curiosity, full of kindness.
          Filming, pacing, storytelling: I love turning a story into shared
          emotion.
