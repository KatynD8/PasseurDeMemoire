        <h3>The concept of a filmed biography</h3>
        <p>
          Tell your life story, that of your parents, your brothers and sisters‚Ä¶  
          Your country of origin, your childhood memories, your family and professional life, the story of your aliyah‚Ä¶  
          Because you are not just a mother or father, a grandmother or grandfather‚Ä¶  
          A filmed biography is a memory gift that connects generations.
        </p>
        <h3>Why make a filmed biography?</h3>
        <p>
          To pass on your memories through images, to share the sound of your voice with your loved ones and future generations.  
          This is possible and easy with a 30 to 60-minute biographical film including photos or videos.  
          From an interview, you can authentically share your memories, your values, your story.  
          It is important to preserve your memory and strengthen intergenerational ties.  
          Have you ever told your love story? Your career path, passions, commitments?  
          Many people regret not having filmed memories of their parents or grandparents, especially their voices‚Ä¶  
          This is now possible thanks to a professional who helps you transmit your memories and emotions through a filmed biography.

          <h5>Meeting and preparation</h5>
          <p>
            I meet you first to introduce myself, get to know you and prepare the interview.  
            We discuss your life, your parents and your loved ones.  
            Together, we prepare the topics and questions you would like to cover.  
            We decide on the story you want to tell and the key moments you want to share.  
            We also review the photos or documents you want to add to your testimony.

          <p>
            The filming can take place at your home or outdoors in a place dear to you.  
            During the shoot, I capture your life story through a face-to-face interview.  
            It is an intimate and privileged moment that you will share with your loved ones.  
            The approach is always kind and fully respects the wishes you expressed during the initial meeting.

          <h5>Editing and delivery of the film</h5>
          <p>
            After the interview, I edit your video biography according to the vision we established, for an authentic and sincere story.  
            You may also choose music or photos to include in the video.  
            Your video biography will be delivered a few weeks later as a downloadable link or on a USB stick so you can watch it on a computer or TV.

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          A memory keeper and a passionate person.  
          I had a first professional life in France in retail and training.  
          When I arrived in Israel, I resumed studies at the University of Jerusalem to become a tour guide.  
          I am passionate about transmitting the history of Israel and the Jewish world.  
          For several years, I have been a TV columnist on topics related to the history of Israel and the Jewish people.  
          I have always been driven by the desire to pass on and share.  
          "Memory Keeper" is the logical continuation of this mission, with a human approach, listening, and an excellent sense of contact.  
          I am driven by genuine curiosity, full of kindness.  
          Filming, pacing, storytelling: I love turning a story into shared emotion.
