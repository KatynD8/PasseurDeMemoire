      <h3>The concept of a filmed biography</h3>
      <p>
        Tell the story of your life, that of your parents, your brothers and
        sisters‚Ä¶ Your country of origin, your childhood memories, your family
        and professional life, the story of your aliyah‚Ä¶ Because you are not
        just a woman or a man, a grandmother or a grandfather‚Ä¶

        <h3>Why make a filmed biography?</h3>
        <p>
          Passing on your memories through images, sharing the sound of your
          voice, for your loved ones and future generations, is possible with a
          30 to 60-minute biographical film including photos or videos. Based on
          an interview, you can authentically share your memories, values, and
          legacy. It is important to preserve your memory and strengthen
          intergenerational bonds. Have you ever shared the story of your love
          encounter? Your professional journey, your passions, your commitments?
          Many people regret not having filmed memories of their parents or
          grandparents. This is now possible thanks to a professional who helps
          you transmit your emotions and memories through a film.

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        I meet you for the first time to introduce myself, get to know you, and
        prepare the interview. Together we discuss your life, your achievements,
        your parents and loved ones. We prepare the topics and questions you
        want to address. We decide on the story you wish to tell and the key
        moments you want to share. During filming, I capture your life story
        through an on-camera interview. It is an intimate and privileged moment
        with you that you will share with your family. The process is always
        kind and fully respects the wishes you expressed during the preliminary
        meeting. After the interview, I take care of editing your video
        biography according to the vision we established for an authentic and
        sincere narrative. You can also choose the music or photos you want to
        include in the video. Your video biography will be delivered a few weeks
        later as a downloadable link and on a USB stick so you can watch your
        film on a computer or television.

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          A passionate person. I had a first professional life in France in the
          world of retail and training. After arriving in Israel, I studied at
          the University of Jerusalem to become a tour guide. I am passionate
          about passing on the history of Israel and the Jewish people and for
          several years I have been a TV columnist for Tandem TV. I have always
          been driven by the desire to pass on and share. Memory Keeper is the
          logical continuation of this mission, with a human approach, attentive
          listening, and a strong sense of connection. I am driven by an
          authentic curiosity filled with kindness. Filming, pacing, telling a
          story: I love turning a story into a shared emotion.
